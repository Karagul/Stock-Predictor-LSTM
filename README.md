# Stock-Predictor-LSTM
This project is a working Stock Price predictor . The user can give it any company's stock from any Index like NASDAQ, NSE,etc. It can be used on any type of market like Stock(Equity), FX (Currency Exchange), FNO (Futures n Options), etc. Be careful to change the READ_CSV line according to your Dataset and add columns if not added but removing "USE_COLS"and replacing it with a list of names of your columns like LIST=["Date","Time","Open", "High"...and so on] as"NAMES=LIST". I am open to changes and suggestions. If there is a query kindly add it in the issues section, I will try my best to help you. Stock traders mainly use three indicators for prediction: OHLC average (average of Open, High, Low and Closing Prices), HLC average (average of High, Low and Closing Prices) and Closing price, In this project, OHLC average has been used.
